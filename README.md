# ContrAlto 2.0

ContrAlto aspires to be a faithful emulation of the Xerox Alto series of 
pioneering graphical workstations developed at Xerox PARC starting in 1973.

At this time, it runs all known software, though some may make use of hardware
that is not yet implemented (RS232, IMP interfaces, etc.)
